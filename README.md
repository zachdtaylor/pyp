## Contributing
Contributions in any form are most welcome! No matter what your experience level or skills (or none, if you just want to discuss some rough ideas), we welcome you to this project with open arms and a wide smile. The only rule we have is that of maintaining good behavior and decorum. Trolling, foul language, personal insults, etc., will NOT be tolerated at all.

### No idea where to start?

If nothing makes sense in the project or you don't know where to begin, don't hesitate to open an issue and put your thoughts/struggles there. We are not pedantic like other communities, and so we don't think issues should be opened only for code-related stuff or bugs. Currently, we don't have a discussion forum, so issues are where we do most of the chatting!

### Local development setup

Finally, if you're a Python developer and are not too sure how to set things up for developing and contributing, please see the file CONTRIBUTING.md.

We sincerely hope you have a great time here!
